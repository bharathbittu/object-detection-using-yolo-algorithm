# object-detection-using-yolo-algorithm
In this project I used YOLO algorithm to classify the objects in input image. I used a pretrained CNN model and the processed the output of CNN to detect objects.
# you can download the pretrained model from thi link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X79ZtIBp-Q70THZapcTeLqffxIqbLx_I/view?usp=sharing
In that link you will dind yolo.h5 in model_data folder.
